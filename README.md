Azure Infrastructure As Code (azure-iac)

Infrastructure as Code refers to the practice of treating the code used to create cloud infrastructure as a versioned repository, similar to traditional software code. This approach utilizes tools such as ARM, Bicep, and Terraform to instantiate this code into an actual cloud ecosystem. By adopting Infrastructure as Code, it becomes more convenient to develop, manage, and deploy cloud infrastructure on a larger scale. Many professional software companies rely on this approach to streamline their operations.

In this repository, you will find several Bicep, ARM, and Terraform templates that define the cloud infrastructure required to support your Digital Twins. These templates serve as a blueprint for provisioning and configuring the necessary resources in the cloud environment.

Follow the Action steps outlined here:
